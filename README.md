# Assignment 1 - Research Track 1
The  main purpose of this repository is to constantly drive the [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org/) simulator robot around the arena in the counter-clockwise direction, while avoiding the golden obstacles, as it also grabs and moves behind it the closely detected silver tokens.

## Installating and Running
The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news), [PyPyBox2D library](https://pypi.org/project/pypybox2d/2.1-r331/), and [PyYAML Library](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/).

Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the test.py script to test out the simulator.\
In order to run one or more scripts in the simulator, use run.py followed by the file names, as the program can be run by the following command line:\
```
$ python run.py RT-Assignment1.py
```
